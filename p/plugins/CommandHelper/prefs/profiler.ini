#  These settings control the integrated profiler

# If a profile point took less than this amount of time (in ms) to run, it won't be logged. This is good for reducing 
# data blindness caused by too much data being displayed. Normally you only care about things that took longer than a 
# certain amount, not things that took less than a certain amount. Setting this to 0 will trigger everything.

# Sets the granularity of the profiler. 1 logs some things, while 5 logs everything possible.

# The location of the profiler output log. The following macros are supported and will expand to the specified values: %Y 
# - Year, %M - Month, %D - Day, %h - Hour, %m - Minute, %s - Second

# Turns the profiler on or off. The profiler can cause a slight amount of lag, so generally speaking you don't leave it
