# Database needs the following structure
# CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `commandhelper` (
#  -- This is an UNHEX(MD5('key')) binary hash of the unlimited length key column, so the table may have a primary key.
#  `key_hash` BINARY(16) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
#  -- This is the key itself, stored for plaintext readability, and for full text searches for getting values
#  `key` TEXT NOT NULL,
#  -- The value itself, which may be null
#  `value` MEDIUMTEXT
# )
#  -- The engine is InnoDB, to support transactions
# ENGINE = InnoDB,
#  -- The charset is utf8, since all keys are utf8, and values are utf8 json
# CHARACTER SET = utf8,
#  -- The collation is case sensitive
# COLLATE = utf8_bin,
#  -- Table comment
# COMMENT = 'MethodScript storage table'
